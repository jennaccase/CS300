# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved was learning how to sort data into different structures so that it can be used in different applications. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures are important to understand because your information can change based on hwo it is stored. It also changes how long your run time is. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had trouble with the different data structures when they were being introduced. I understood them on paper and in the Zybooks but coding them was a lot harder. It was nice though that the data structures will typically be coded the same way whenever hey are used so it became easier throughout the course. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It made me think a lot more about how data can be sorted in order to be used. It also showed how difficult it can be to select the best type of data structure. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The more I work on these kinds of projects, the more I improve with how readable the code is. I really struggled with the organization of my code when I first started this program, but I think I have come a long way since then.
